As a junior software engineer working for a movie streaming service, you're tasked with developing a program to manage movie data. 
Movies can have various attributes like title, director, release year, and a list of actors.

In this lab, you will practice using lists and tuples to store and manipulate movie data. 
Tuples are ideal for storing information that shouldn't change, like a movie's title and director, while lists are suitable for data that might be modified, like the cast (actors).

For this lab, you will use information from the movie The Shawshank Redemption. 

You will define two variables for this lab:

movie_info
cast

Define the two variables to store movie information using the code snippet below: 
movie_info = ("The Shawshank Redemption", "Frank Darabont")
cast = ["Tim Robbins", "Morgan Freeman", "Bob Gunton"]
new_actor = "William Sadler"

Accessing Movie Data: Write code to access and print individual elements. 
Modifying Cast List: Simulate adding a new actor to the cast.
