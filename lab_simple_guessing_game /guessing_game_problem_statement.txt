As a software engineer, you've been tasked with developing a simple guessing game for a mobile app. 

Users will guess a secret number within a limited number of attempts. 
This lab will guide you through implementing this game using while loops in Python. 

In this lab, you will implement a while loop to control game flow, generate random numbers, handle user input, and apply conditional statements within a loop structure.

For this lab, you will create a Python program that generates a random secret number between 1 and 10 (inclusive) and allows the user to guess it within five attempts. 
Provide feedback to the user based on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. 
The game should continue prompting for guesses until the user wins or exhausts their attempts.

Game Requirements:

Generate a random secret number between 1 and 10.
Allow only five attempts.
Provide feedback to the user if their guess is too high, too low, or correct."""
